## Translations

Thanks for your help translating the HappyShield website and instructions!

Here's how to contribute translations!

We need to translate the following files in this website (XX is the [ISO code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) for the language): 

```
index_XX.md
Instructions/HandCreasing/handCreasing_XX.md
Instructions/LaserCut/laserCut_XX.md
Instructions/LaserCutAndPressureCreasing/laserCutAndPressureCreasing_XX.md
Instructions/WaveShield/waveShield_XX.md
```

To translate (or edit an existing translation), 

1. Navigate to the relevant file in this repository.
2. Click "Edit this File"
3. Type any changes you would like to make to the text in the file. 
4. Add a description explaining the changes you have made.
5. Commit the changes ("Propose File Change")

You can see this process explained nicely here! https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/#commit

You can repeat this process any number of times. When you would like your work to be incorporated into the main repository. 

1. Create Pull Request
2. Add any helpful description along with your Pull Request to explain to others what you have added or changed to the text.

Auri will review and approve the pull request, and then merge these into the main repository, where they should be rendered on the live website within 3-5 minutes.
